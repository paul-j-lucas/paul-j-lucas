## History

Paul started programming on Commodore PETs at his high school.
Courtesy of his parents,
the first computer he owned was an Apple IIplus
that he programmed in BASIC,
Pascal,
Fortran,
and 6502 Assembly language.
At some point,
he upgraded to a Macintosh.
During his undergraduate studies,
he taught myself C.
He's been programming in C
(on and off)
ever since.
He's also programmed in
Bash,
Go,
Java,
Perl,
and
Python.
Of all those,
C
and C++
are still his favorites.

He started his career at AT&T Bell Labs
in telephony,
log file visualization,
testing [cfront](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cfront),
and wrote the _The C++ Programmer's Handbook_
(Prentice-Hall, 1992).
He's also worked at NASA Ames Research Center,
various start-ups,
and lastly at Splunk.
He holds patents on data visualization class libraries,
visual log file analysis,
programming language type systems,
skewing of scheduled search queries,
and cache-aware searching.

He developed open-source projects
including CHSM,
a finite state automata compiler
and run-time system,
used by both telecommunications companies
and CERN
for managing complex reactive systems;
and maintains [`cdecl`](https://github.com/paul-j-lucas/cdecl)
(‘‘see-deh-kull’’),
the C and C++
gibberish-to-English translator.

Most recently,
he's published [Why Learn C](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/979-8-8688-1597-3)
(Apress, 2025).
